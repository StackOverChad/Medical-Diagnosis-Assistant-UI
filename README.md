# Medical Diagnosis Models

This project includes multiple trained machine learning and deep learning models for various medical diagnosis tasks such as:

- Breast Histopathology
- Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detection
- COVID-19 Radiography
- Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
- Diabetes Prediction
- Heart Failure Prediction
- Stroke Prediction
- Symptom-based Disease Prediction

## 📁 Project Structure

- `.keras` files — Trained Keras models.
- `.joblib` files — Scikit-learn models and preprocessing tools.
- `.json` files — Class name mappings for Keras models.
- `requirements` — Python package dependencies.
- `app.py` — Main Python script (presumably for API or UI integration).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
```
2. Activate it:
-Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
-macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

3.Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements
